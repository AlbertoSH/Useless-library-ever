Useless library anyone ever wrote

## Overview

**Useless library ever** breaks your code. Literally. Your `.java` files will still be there (I'm not as bad)
but forget about using the `.class` compiled. **Any call to any method (even constructors) will throw a `RuntimeException` 
claiming that you're ugly**

---

## Features

* Reduces incredibly the size of the compiled files
* Breaks your code

--- 

## Installation

Just add the dependency into your project. It doesn't event need to be a runtime dependency. With just
compile time dependency your code will be broken

    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    
    dependencies{
        compile 'com.github.albertosh:useless-library-ever:1.0.0'
    }

## How it works

By invoking ancient powers I can channel all the evil forces into your computer and make it obbey my commands

(Yes, I love that fucking gif)

**OK, now just be serious, please. How do you do that?**

I just modify the AST of your classes. This is just an example of how dangerous a non reliable library 
can be. If you want an example of how powerfull this technique can be you can check my library [MagicBuilder](https://github.com/AlbertoSH/MagicBuilder)

**Why did you do such a stupid library?**
